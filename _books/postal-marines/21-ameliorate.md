hook-1: Novice Postal Marine gets into a battle of wits with the AI embedded in his brain on the eve of the largest Postal Service battle in history.
hook-2: Never fight a battle of wits with an AI embedded in your brain. That's what Postal Marine Bophendze must do to keep sane.
hook: Could you win a battle of wits with the AI wired into your brain? That's just what Postal Marine Danel Bophendze must do to keep sane.
summary: TBD
taglines: "Unstable AI, unproven warriors: survival hangs in the balance. A suicide mission, a chance at redemption: will failure be their legacy? Stranded and desperate, a groundbreaking discovery alters the course of war. New alliances and hidden power: can they outwit an enemy and save a world?"
notes: The Bophendze Quartet contains the first four books that give the entire Postal Marines its structure. Follow the life of Danel Bophendze from incompetent scrub to worn-out myrmidon. In Bellicose, he embeds an AI with a mind of his own into his brain, and struggles to survive the Battle of Tanhusio Gate. In Gambit, he partners with Jonaldy Ammonett to save the crown prince's wife and prevent a tilt in the balance of power. By Imbroglio, he's tired and frustrated. Fate deals him a cruel blow as he finds himself stranded in a dangerous, far-flung star system. But instead of succumbing to despair, he stumbles upon a game-changing technology with the potential to transform the Core Imperium. He retreats to Copio in Scintilla, where he becomes an unlikely mentor to Mondennio Rowenzal who must resist dark forces seeking to convert him and subvert the planetary government."
